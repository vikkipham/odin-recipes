    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>
        Here's an old-fashioned carrot cake that's got more carrots than spice. Pecans can be substituted for walnuts.
    </h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¾ cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups grated carrots</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
        <li>1 cup flaked coconut</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>4 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish; set aside.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>
            Mix together sugar, oil, buttermilk, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a large bowl until well combined. Stir in carrots, pineapple, and coconut. Combine flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl; gently stir into carrot mixture. Mix in nuts until incorporated. Spread batter into the prepared dish.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong>
            Beat together confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, butter, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy. Frost cooled cake while still in the dish.
